## What is Tic Tac Toe?

1. Tic Tae is a 2 player game where the goal is to mark your signs/symbols X or 0 in consecutively.
2. It is usually played on a 3x3 board but can be played on bigger boards. So a 3x3 board the goal is to complete 3 signs consecutively.
3. It can either be horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
4. Every player plays alternatively. If no consecutive pattern is made, it is a draw!

## Tic Tac Toe Game Rules

- Every player makes alternate moves.
- Valid moves are only in blank squares where no move has been already made.
- If pattern of same symbols is formed, horizontally, vertically or diagonally the player doing so wins.
- If no consecutive pattern is formed, it is a draw!
- Check Game Instructions section for detailed instructions on how to play the game with images.
